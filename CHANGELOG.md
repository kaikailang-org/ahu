## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository scaffolding: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `VERSION`
  (`0.0.1`), `CHANGELOG.md`, and empty `src/` / `tests/` / `examples/`
  trees.
- `docs/design.md` — design specification for ahu, the kaikai-native
  concurrency and fault-tolerance framework. Pivoted on 2026-05-02
  from an OTP-style draft to a three-layer design: streams, cells,
  and restart helpers. Pins the seven load-bearing decisions, the
  `ahu-Tongariki` MVP scope, and the rationale for diverging from OTP.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — milestone series for ahu following the Rapa Nui
  naming convention shared with kaikai (Tongariki, Anga Roa, Orongo,
  Anakena), with scope, definition-of-done, and sequencing
  constraints. Rewritten alongside the design pivot.
- `docs/lane-experience-ahu-design.md` — retrospective for the design
  lane, including the pivot from OTP-style to streams + cells +
  restart helpers and the reasoning that motivated it.

### Changed

- **2026-05-02 design pivot.** The first iteration of `docs/design.md`
  pinned an OTP-style framework (`Behavior` as record of callbacks,
  `Supervisor` with `one_for_one` strategy, `Application`). The
  rewritten document supersedes that draft with a three-layer
  kaikai-native design: streams as Layer 1 (the primary paradigm
  for data flow), cells as Layer 2 (recursive-function shape from
  Akka Typed), and restart helpers as Layer 3 (no `Supervisor`
  type — supervision strategies fall out of nursery placement).
  Rationale: OTP's shape compensates for Erlang runtime constraints
  (no structured concurrency, untyped messages, hot reload) that
  kaikai does not have. The earlier draft is preserved in
  `docs/design.md`'s git history.
